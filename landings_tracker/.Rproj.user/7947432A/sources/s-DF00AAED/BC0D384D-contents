# Plan and conduct scientific research    
- Produced high quality Economic Data about the West Coast Groundfish Trawl Catch Share Program by running the Economic Data Collection (EDC) Program
    + Maintained database that connects fish ticket, observer, economic, permit, quota, and regulatory information to streamline research projects by other ESSR staff and to ensure consistent inputs.
    + Redesigned the fish ticket tables in the FRAM data warehouse to ensure that they contain the most up-to-date data and all columns available in PacFIN.
    + Coordinated with the Office of Law Enforcement to develop mitigation plans for participants who repeatedly turn in late EDC forms or consistently provide inaccurate information.
    + Responded to data requests from outside researchers, Council, State Agency and FRAM staff.
- Implemented the first ever in the US quota share owner survey that was approved by the PFMC in November 2018 to inform fishery managers about the distribution of benefits across geographic areas and participation types:
    + Developed statement of work and hiring materials to hire contractor to support the Quota Share Owner Survey.
    + Coordinated with WCR permit office, groundfish branch staff, SDM and the FRAM Data Team to develop relevant regulations, Paperwork Reduction Act packages, communication and outreach plans, and to integrate the survey into the Quota Share Permit renewal system.
    + Conducted network analysis of ownership relationships to understand the reach of the Quota Share Owner Survey on individual quota owners.
    + Led survey efforts by developing FAQ sheets, a new website, contacting participants to test the survey, and fielding calls from participants concerned about being asking to submit more information.
- Developed and implemented COVID mitigation plans for the EDC and Quota Share surveys. Under normal conditions, we mail paper packets to each participant, field regular phone calls from a wide range of fishery participants, enter the paper form data as they come in, and meet in-person regularly throughout the survey fielding season. To mitigate the impacts of mandatory telework, we establish protocols for mailing packets from home, schedules for visiting the office and exchanging forms so they could be entered into the database, and systems for communicating with participants without using our personal cell phones or sharing or private phone numbers.
- Led two efforts to improve our ability to analyze the effects of the Catch Share Program:
    + Development of methods for incorporating voluntary cost and earnings data collected from 2003-2008 into the catch shares database.
    + Development of new groupings of catch share vessel participants to find more intuitive/meaningful units for comparison for both reporting and research purposes.
- Wrote a 5-year research plan for myself and the EDC Program.
- Proposed and participated in an NRAP detail at the West Coast Region Groundfish Branch. Major tasks completed include finding ways to make the ESSR net revenue forecast models more useful, participating in ranking of the Catch Shares and Magnuson-Stevens Act proposals, and developing a workshop (postponed by COVID) to bring together NWFSC groundfish scientists and WCR groundfish permits staff and regulation writers to help the NWFSC staff understand how their information is used in management and for WCR staff to learn about the science we do at the NWFSC and how to find and use the information being produced.
- Supported Council Actions by:
    + Developing and implementing a plan for net revenue analysis for the Biennial Harvest Specifications for 2021-2022 (nrap detail). This included developing a system for loading the paper records into the database and creating models to forecast net revenue and total wages for Biennial Harvest Specification management alternatives for the "Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery 2021-2022 Harvest Specifications and Management Measures Environmental Assessment". 
   + Conducting ownership interest analyses in response to requests from the Ad Hoc Sablefish Management and Trawl Allocation Attainment Committee.

# Communicate scientific research    
- Attended November 2019 PFMC meeting to follow the creation of the harvest specification and management measures.
- Improved availability of EDC data to internal researchers and the public by making improvements to our data exploration tool (FISHEyE), including:
    + Redesign of the shorebased processor metrics and creating new metrics to complement the metrics for the other sectors.    
    + Developed a purchase and production application to allow users to see more detailed information about the species and products being produced by our processing sector.
    + Drafted an outline and started writing a FISHEyE Performance Metrics Tech Memo to formally document all of the methods included in FISHEyE.
- Supported requests for information about the impacts of COVID-19 on industry participants by:
    + Leading the development of the NWFSC Landings Tracker tool that allows the public to look at historical landings patterns of all fisheries landed on the West Coast of the US. This involved coordinating with PacFIN, SWFSC, and the states to ensure that we were correctly identifying fisheries and accurately conveying the completeness of the real-time statistics. The landings tracker emphasizes current monthly landings patterns relative to historical landings.
    + Serving as NWFSC Commercial fisheries lead for "NOAA Fisheries Initial Impacts Assessment of the COVID-19 Crisis on the U.S. Commercial Seafood and Recreational For-Hire/Charter Industries Report", including coordinating data preparation efforts with PacFIN, SWFSC, and the states, coordinating with HQ/ST and the WCR Office to ensure that all of the descriptions included in the report accurately reflect our understanding of the state of the fisheries on the West Coast. Further assisted with preparation of materials for subsequent COVID-related data calls and responded to requests for clarifying information from HQ. 
    + Contacting industry participants to learn about how COVID-19 is affecting their businesses and fishing opportunities.
- Conducted a case study of West Coast groundfish using methods in the draft "NOAA Fisheries Guidance on Measuring Returns in Fishing Businesses" Tech Memo. Also served as a reviewer for the Tech Memo.
- Funded an academic partnership to produce the paper: "Market Power in a quota-managed fishery" in response to questions posed by the PFMC as part of the follow-on actions from the 5-year review. In addition to providing data, facilitating listening sessions with industry, and providing information about the fishery to the researchers, I organized reviews of the first draft from three NWFSC Economists. The draft is currently undergoing revisions.
        
# Logistical, Administrative, and Safety    
- Practiced appropriate work behavior.
- Safeguarded my computer and sensitive information by encrypting my laptop, external hard drive and locked my file cabinets.
- Complied with all training, time and attendance, and property management as required by the Center and FRAM.
- Developed multiple COVID-related plans, including a plan for obtaining EDC paper forms from the office to balance the need for COVID-related safety while conducting QAQC in a timely and efficient manner and a plan for developing and distributing Quota Share Owner Survey outreach materials in collaboration with the West Coast Region.
- Met all new requirements associated with being a purchase card holder, including attending two trainings, learning the new purchase card web system, learning and executing purchase reconciliation, and maintaining communication with Division Coordinator to ensure the proper budget codes were billed.

# Outreach, Communication and Service    
- Served on multiple advisory groups, including:
    + Conducted reviews of three Staltonstall-Kennedy grants.
    + Attended the PacFIN Data Committee meeting in October, 2019 in Portland, OR to ensure that PacFIN continues to meet the needs of NWFSC economists.
- Filled many data requests, including:
    + Coordinated SWFSC and PacFIN staff to create baseline commercial revenue by fishery to evaluate impacts of COVID-19.
    + Multiple requests for costs to industry for electronic monitoring and observer coverage.
    + Multiple requests about geographic distribution of processing operations including request from Council staff, Chris Harvey as part of Packard Foundation Grant, and WCR Permits Office.
- Handled phone calls from concerned fishermen and other industry participants, treating each participant with respect and either providing them the necessary information to meet their needs to referring them to the appropriate NMFS personnel that could assist them further.
- Met regularly with supervisor to keep him apprised of potential emerging issues in the groundfish fishery and in the Economic Data Collection Program.
- Served as mentor and provided direction, oversight and guidance for three contractors: one EDC contractors, one quota share owner survey contractor, and half-time FRAM Data Team contractor as well as mentorship for FTE responsible for the Shorebase Processor component of the EDC Survey.
- Trained new hire on use of our database, using cost and earnings data, West Coast fisheries operations, and the biennial harvest specification analyses.
- Worked with the Office of Law Enforcement and the West Coast Region to ensure compliance and to train new West Coast Region staff about the EDC Program.
- Conducted webinar with BLS staff to demonstrate our shiny app and help them develop procedures and policies to implement a shiny app/server for their data.
- Worked with West Coast Region staff and NWFSC economists to generate groundfish impact estimates and to ensure accurate descriptions of the estimates in the "Story Map: West Coast Groundfish Amendment 28".
- Worked with PacFIN to improve their metadata that they provide for the data tables they present by helping to clarify language and identify areas of confusion.
- Served on the NWFSC Team for Inclusion, Diversity, and Equity and led several activities:
    + Developing a proposal for implementing a plan for more inclusive hiring practices at the NWFSC. Coordinated with staff at Southwest Fisheries Science Center, West Coast Region, and Alaska Fisheries Science Center to develop inclusive hiring practices actions
    + Developing a month-long lunch and learn series to learn about how we as NWFSC staff and as an organization can be anti-racist.
    + Organizing an end-of-year training on how to avoid using microaggressions and how to respond to microaggressions in the workplace.
- Supported the FRAM M-Team by participating in several discussions about how to prioritize Data Team activities and assembled a proposal based on input from M-Team members
